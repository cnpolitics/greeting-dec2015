<p class="salu">Dear Professor Jian Zheng,</p>

<p>We, the CNPolitics team, are writing to thank you for lending us generous support in the past, and to send our best wishes for the new year. It has been a great honor for us to present to the Chinese audience your scholarly work and insights. We hope to continue doing so in the future, as we strive to introduce quality social science research to the Chinese general public.</p>

<p>To wrap up the year of 2015, CNPolitics plans to publish a list of what scholars think is this yearâ€™s most important and original social science research. Thus, would it be possible for you to name several pieces of research that in your opinion showcases the very best of your discipline and field in 2015 and briefly explain why? Your input would be really, really appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks again, and we wish you and your family a relaxing, refreshing and warm holiday season.</p>
